      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The Time Travel Agency started from humble beginnings with a time machine built in our founder's backyard.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Originally created in a moment of procrastination and a wish to play video games rather than study, now our time travelling device takes thousands of people on journeys through time and space.
